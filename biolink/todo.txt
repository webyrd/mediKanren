HIGH PRIORITY
* Matt : 2-hop query--want to modify a target T;  may need to find X that modifies Y that modifies T
(need to link concepts and synonyms across data sets)


* update defaults for synthetic predicates
* add blacklist to default config file, for things like 'Disease' in Semmeddb, etc.  Make sure this list is respected in *every* relevant 'run' expression (for example, need to filter before determining which predicates are available)
* consider adding a mode for aggressively checking/pruning likely low quality/howler answers (for example, the innumerable incorrect answers in Semmeddb due to gene aliasing colliding with random short abbreviations for non-genes)
* figure out what to do when concepts in more than one KG has an identical CUI (there can still be differences in the Category and Name, for example!)  For example, for 'X has_phentype SOX5', 'Robokop' and 'orange' each have a concept for SOX5 with MONDO:0017782 as the CUI, but with slightly different category and name info!
* add ability to annotate queries/answers, or otherwise provide feedback for good/suspicious/missing answers (potentially send to some central place, or at least save locally)
* create window for getting all info about a specified gene (run a bunch of standard mini-queries and display results/report)
* create window for Workflow 1 and Workflow X modules
* workflow builder
* figure out how to make the deep blue selection color easier to read
* add ability to import and use user data
* be able to answer the SH3 / tau question


Standardization
* support emerging 9.1 input/output standard


Refactoring/Generalization/Consistency
* auto-select the first X entry once the X concept list is populated
* be able to specify a gene, drug, etc., by standard IDs (ENSMBL, etc) (need to index by these IDs, etc)
* add ability to find all edges with a given PubMed ID to interface (see find-edges-by-pubmed-id.rkt; will probably need to index Orange and RTX KGs as well)
* consolidate/generalize code for outputting 'last.???' save files
* generalize code for synthetic predicates, so user can add/override new synthetic predicates from config files
* update the ISA checkbox to handle ontological connections in a more sophisticated way
* be able to query between KGs in a single query (like in 'imatinib [decreases] X [increases] asthma')
* add a simple query builder window, similar to ROBOKOP
* double-clicking on any property entry should copy the Value to the clipboard
* be able to (efficiently?) find all edges for a given predicate/predicates


Performance/Responsiveness
* add interruptible thread tech for when clicking on predicates, just like we have for concept string searches


old TODOs

====================================


;;; TODO FIXME

;;; NGLY1 in concept 2
;;; semmed
;;; interacts_with
;;; FAF1 gene


;;; Extract Pubmed ids from the alist of properties in the full path

;;; semmed:
;;; ("pmids" . "27748395")

;;; rtx:
;;;

;;; monarch-lite:
;;;

;;; TODO FEATURES
;;;
;;; hotkeys for moving between panes, etc.--should be able to do everything from the keyboard

;;; Improve sorting to take into account num of pub med entries

;;; TODO
;;;
;;; recognize concept name containing only whitespace as being empty
;;;
;;; use a reasonable default sorting for the concepts
;;;
;;; add ability to sort concept columns by clicking on column titles
;;;
;;; speed up concept search--seems much slower than in the old mediKanren
;;; (perhaps consider searching one DB exhaustively before moving to the next one)
;;;
;;; add ability to include only some of the data sources
;;;
;;; add ability to show and hide concept columns
;;;
;;; add ability to show date of data sources, and date/provenance for results
;;;
;;; add ability to specify/filter by data source or category


;;; ISSUES
;;;
;;; Seem to be missing '<gene> has_phenotype alacrima' entries for
;;; HEXA and GBA, even though these seem to be in the Monarch website.
;;; Why?
;;;
;;; Different data sources have what are effectively duplicate entries,
;;; but it isn't always easy to tell.
;;;
;;; Different data sources have different category numbers for the
;;; same CUI/entity.  For example, 'Imatinib mesylate' has the 'UMLS:C0939537'
;;; CUI in both Semmed and Scigraph, yet the category is (5 . "chemical_substance")
;;; for Semmed and (21 . "chemical_substance") for Scigraph.  Why?
;;; (The concept IDs are different in this case)
