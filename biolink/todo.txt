* double-clicking on any property entry should copy the Value to the clipboard
* make sure to pick up pubmed entries is unusual places
* be able to specify a gene, drug, etc., by standard IDs (ENSMBL, etc) (need to index by these IDs, etc)
* add ability to find all edges wiht a give PubMed ID to interface (see find-edges-by-pubmed-id.rkt; will probably need to index Orange and RTX KGs as well)
* add interruptible thread tech for when clicking on predicates, just like we have for concept string searches













old TODOs

====================================


;;; TODO FIXME

;;; NGLY1 in concept 2
;;; semmed
;;; interacts_with
;;; FAF1 gene


;;; Extract Pubmed ids from the alist of properties in the full path

;;; semmed:
;;; ("pmids" . "27748395")

;;; rtx:
;;;

;;; monarch-lite:
;;;

;;; TODO FEATURES
;;;
;;; hotkeys for moving between panes, etc.--should be able to do everything from the keyboard

;;; Improve sorting to take into account num of pub med entries

;;; TODO
;;;
;;; recognize concept name containing only whitespace as being empty
;;;
;;; use a reasonable default sorting for the concepts
;;;
;;; add ability to sort concept columns by clicking on column titles
;;;
;;; speed up concept search--seems much slower than in the old mediKanren
;;; (perhaps consider searching one DB exhaustively before moving to the next one)
;;;
;;; add ability to include only some of the data sources
;;;
;;; add ability to show and hide concept columns
;;;
;;; add ability to show date of data sources, and date/provenance for results
;;;
;;; add ability to specify/filter by data source or category


;;; ISSUES
;;;
;;; Seem to be missing '<gene> has_phenotype alacrima' entries for
;;; HEXA and GBA, even though these seem to be in the Monarch website.
;;; Why?
;;;
;;; Different data sources have what are effectively duplicate entries,
;;; but it isn't always easy to tell.
;;;
;;; Different data sources have different category numbers for the
;;; same CUI/entity.  For example, 'Imatinib mesylate' has the 'UMLS:C0939537'
;;; CUI in both Semmed and Scigraph, yet the category is (5 . "chemical_substance")
;;; for Semmed and (21 . "chemical_substance") for Scigraph.  Why?
;;; (The concept IDs are different in this case)
