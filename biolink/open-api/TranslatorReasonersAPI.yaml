        The Query class is used to package a user request for information. A
        Query object consists of a required Message object with optional
        additional properties. Additional properties are intended to convey
        implementation-specific or query-independent parameters. For example,
        an additional property specifying a log level could allow a user to
        override the default log level in order to receive more fine-grained
        log information when debugging an issue.

            as part of the Message, whereas other operations, e.g. overlay,

            CURIE of the semantic type of the attribute. For properties
            defined by the Biolink model this should be a biolink CURIE,
            otherwise, if possible, from the EDAM ontology. If a suitable
            identifier does not exist, enter a descriptive phrase here and
            submit the new type for consideration by the appropriate
            authority.

        CURIE for a Biolink 'predicate' slot, taken from the Biolink slot

        A Compact URI, consisting of a prefix and a reference separated

        definition, the CURIE prefix and colon may be replaced by a URI
        prefix, such as http://identifiers.org/uniprot/, to form a full
        URI.
