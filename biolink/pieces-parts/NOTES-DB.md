- db.rkt exposes the data, and indexes.
  - Only lookup what you need by offset.
- mk-db.rkt bridges the gap between db and mk.
- db:edgeo in mk-db.rkt
  - db represents an entire database, that contains tables and indexes
  - edge is miniKanren term to populate
  - implementation not relational, escapes to Racket and uses indexes according to where the variables are
- common.rkt provides conde/databases to lookup over all knowledge sources (databases). Uses tagging to disambiguate the knowledge source.
- dbKanren would enable more things to be done relationally as in Datalog. Express fixpoint computations relationally instead of in Racket. Also will be able to mix top-down and bottom-up relations. Top-down queries prune the search space quickly.
