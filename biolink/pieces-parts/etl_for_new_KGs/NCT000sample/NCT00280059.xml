Each subscale comprised of 7 items; range: 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms. Scores relative to start of randomized treatment.</description>

    <description>MOS-SS: subject-rated instrument used to assess the key constructs of sleep over the past week; assesses sleep quantity and quality and is comprised 12 items yielding 7 subscale scores and 2 composite index scores. Optimal Sleep subscale is derived from sleep quantity average hours of sleep each night during the past week. Number of subjects with response Optimal if sleep quantity was 7 or 8 hours of sleep per night, and Non-optimal if average sleep was less than or greater than 7 to 8 hours per night. Analysis assesses the MOS-Sleep scale relative to the start of randomized treatment.</description>

        <description>All partial seizures include complex partial seizures, simple partial seizures, and partial seizures evolving to secondarily generalized seizures. Seizure frequency based on 28-day seizure rate: number (#) of seizures in period (month) divided by # days in period minus # of missing diary days in period * 28. Responder = participant who achieved at least 6 months of seizure freedom after Week 4 and up to Week 56.

        <description>Participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items; range: 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms. Scores relative to start of randomized treatment.</description>
